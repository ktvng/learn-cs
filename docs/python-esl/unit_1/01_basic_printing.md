## Printing Basics ##

> **Program**: A program is a set of instructions written by humans to tell a computer to do an action.

Let's get started by creating the most simple of Python programs!

Go ahead and copy the following line into the Python editor:

```py
print('Hello World!')
```

And then go ahead and run the program. You should see `Hello World!` printed to the screen. Congratulations, you've built and run your very first Python program! :tada:

You might also notice that there are quotes surrounding `Hello World` in program. These are needed around text we are printing in the program, but the quotes themselves aren't printed to the screen. Let's try another example:

```py
print('Hello friends')
```

We can expand further to see what else Python is capable of printing by copying the following line:

```py
print(2)
```

And viola, we can print numbers to the screen as well.

## Exercises ##

1. print `14` to the screen
2. print `Hello Kevin!` to the screen
3. print `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` to the screen

## Questions ##
1. What happens if you don't print anything to print? Try running `print()` and see what happens.

## Recap ##
1. `print('...')` will print the text inside the quotes to the screen when the program is run
2. `print(<number>)` will print the number to the screen when the program is run
