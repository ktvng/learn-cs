## Variables -- defining number variables ##

In the previous lesson, we covered some basic math operations and how we can use Python to do the hard calculations for us so we don't have to do them by hand.

To begin this lesson, paste the following 2 lines of code into the Python editor: 

```py
my_number = 24
print(my_number)
```

What do you think will get printed here? __________

As you might have guessed, 24 will be printed here because we assigned `my_number` the value of `24`.

> **Variable**: a variable allows humans to interact with numbers using a human readable name. Note that quotes are not needed around the variable name `my_number`

There are 2 important details to note about a variable:
1. its name, which is how we as programmers will interact with the variable
2. its value, which in this case will be a number

Here's another example of how we can use a variable to store a number
```py
sum = 5 + 6
print(sum)
```

As you might expect, this program will print out `11` to the screen when run.

Lastly, we can use operations on variables as if they were the numbers themselves:
```py
sum = 11
print(sum + 2)
```
And this should print 13 as expected!

## Exercises ##
1. create a variable named `age` and set it equal to your age, and print that value + 2 to the screen
2. print a variable named `zero` that equals `0`

## Recap ##
1. We can use variables with human readable names to store, access numbers. 
2. These variables can be used in place of numbers in math expressions and equations
