## Printing Basics ##

Let's get started by creating the most simple of Python program!

Go ahead and copy the following line into the Python editor:

`print('Hello, World!')`

And then go ahead and run the program. You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the screen. Congratulations, you've built and run you first Python program! 

You might also notice that there are quotes surrounding `Hello World` in program. These are needed around text we are printing in the program, but the quotes themselves aren't printed to the screen. Let's try another example:

`print('Hello friends')`

We can expand further to see what else Python is capable of printing by copying the following line:

`print(2)`

And viola, we can print numbers to the screen as well.

Exercises:

1. print `14` to the screen
2. print `Hello Kevin!` to the screen
3. print `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` to the screen

### Recap ###
1. `print('...')` will print the text inside the quotes to the screen when the program is run
2. `print(<number>)` will print the number to the screen when the program is run
