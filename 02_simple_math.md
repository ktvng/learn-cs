## Math operators ##
In the first lesson, we saw how we could print text using Python! Now, let us explore what else we can do:

Go to the Python editor and copy the following line:

`print(9+10)`

Before running this program, what would you expect the output to be? ___________

Now, run the program and see what the output is. Does it match what you would expect?

Now that we've covered that addition can be evaluated, what other operations do you think can be used in python?

`+`

`-`

`*`

`/`

`()`

While these are some of the most basic operators used in math, they can be combined to calculate many different math equations

For instance, if asked to calulate `17*345+6543/3+(77-2)+89`, it might be pretty difficult to calculate the answer in our head with such big numbers. Luckily, we can ask the computer to be the calculator for us by printing that expression  

Exercise: Simpilfy the expression: `17*345+6543/3+77-2+89` ____________________
